7\. What happens when you run the following code? Why?
```
NAME = 'Victor'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)

NAME = 'Nina'
print('Good Morning, ' + NAME)
print('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME)
print('Good Evening, ' + NAME)
```

**> Solution**
The program first greets Victor three times, then greets Nina three times.\
Python doesn't have real constants, so it is up to the programmer not to change the value of a constant.\
If this variable needs to be changed, `NAME` should be a regular, non-constant variable, and be renamed `name`.
