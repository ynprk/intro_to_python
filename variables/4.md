4\. Classify the following potential **class** names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.
| **Name**          |
| ----------------- |
| `index`           |
| `CatName`         |
| `Lazy_Dog`        |
| `1ST`             |
| `operand2`        |
| `BigNumber3`      |
| `Πi`              |

**> Solution**
| **Name**          | **Status**         |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | 
| `index`           | non-idiomatic      |
| `CatName`         | idiomatic          |
| `Lazy_Dog`        | non_idiomatic      |
| `1ST`             | illegal            |
| `operand2`        | non-idiomatic      | 
| `BigNumber3`      | idiomatic          |
| `Πi`              | non-idiomatic      |

Non-idiomatic:\
index and operand2 use snake_case. Cat_Name uses a weird mix of snake_case and PascalCase. We should use PascalCase for classes. Index, Operand2, and CatName would be idiomatic. Πi contains a non-ASCII character. ProductI would be idiomatic.

Illegal:\
1ST: identifiers cannot start with a number. First would be idiomatic.
