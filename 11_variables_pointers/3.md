3\. Without running this code, what will it print? Why?
```
dict1 = {
    "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy": 42,
    'Monty Python': 'The Life of Brian',
    'Airplane!': "Don't call me Shirley!",
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict2['Monty Python'] = 'Holy Grail'
print(dict1['Monty Python'])
```

**> Solution**\
The code outputs`'The Life of Brian'`. The constructor call `dict(dict1)` creates a new dict that contains the same key/value pairs as dict1. Thus, dict2 is not the same object as dict1. When we change the value associated with the 'Monty Python' key in dict2, we don't see a corresponding change in dict1.
