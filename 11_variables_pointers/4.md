4\. Without running this code, what will it print? Why?
```
dict1 = {
    'a': [1, 2, 3],
    'b': (4, 5, 6),
}

dict2 = dict(dict1)
dict1['a'][1] = 42
print(dict2['a'])
```

**> Solution**\
The code outputs`[1, 42, 3]`. The constructor call `dict(dict1)` creates a shallow copy of dict1. The two dicts are different objects, but share references to nested objects.
