2\. Without running this code, what will it print? Why?
```
set1 = {42, 'Monty Python', ('a', 'b', 'c')}
set2 = set1
set1.add(range(5, 10))
print(set2)
```
Don't worry about having an exact match for the output. The important part is to show something that accurately represents set2. 

**> Solution**
```
{42, 'Monty Python', ('a', 'b', 'c'), range(5, 10)} # order may be different
```
set1 and set2 reference the same object in memory. Assigning a variable to another variable doesn't create a new object. Instead, Python copies a reference from the original variable (set1) into the target variable (set2).
