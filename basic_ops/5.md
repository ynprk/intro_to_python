5\. Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the list's length? For example:
```
foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?
```

**> Solution**
Yes, this will raise an index out of range error. Indices go from 0 to len(sequence) - 1. (Or -1 to -len(sequence) if accessing from the last index.)
