10\. The following code uses the randrange function from Python's random library to obtain and print a random integer within a given range. Using a while loop, it keeps running until it finds a random number that matches the last number in the range. Refactor the code so it doesn't require two different invocations of randrange.

randrange.py
```
import random

highest = 10
number = random.randrange(highest + 1)
print(number)

while number != highest:
    number = random.randrange(highest + 1)
    print(number)
```

**> Solution**
```
import random

highest = 10
while True:
    number = random.randrange(highest + 1)
    print(number)
    if number == highest:
        break
```
We combine a `while True` loop with a `break` statement to emulate a do-while loop.
