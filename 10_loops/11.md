11\. Challenging Problem: Don't feel bad if you struggle with this problem or can't solve it. The problem is not easy. It is designed to demonstrate why we prefer to use for loops when we can, and a big part of that problem is messy code that is difficult to write and understand. See how far you can get, but don't spend much time struggling.

Print all of the even numbers in the following list of nested lists. This time, don't use any for loops.

```
my_list = [
  [1, 3, 6, 11],
  [4, 2, 4],
  [9, 17, 16, 0],
]
```
Expected Output
```
6
4
2
4
16
0
```

**> Solution**
```
my_list = [
  [1, 3, 6, 11],
  [4, 2, 4],
  [9, 17, 16, 0],
]

outer_index = 0
while outer_index < len(my_list):
    inner_index = 0
    while inner_index < len(my_list[outer_index]):
        number = my_list[outer_index][inner_index]
        if number % 2 == 0:
            print(number)
        inner_index += 1
    outer_index += 1
```
