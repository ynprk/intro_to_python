2\. Modify the age.py program you wrote in Exercise 3 of the Input/Output chapter. The updated code should use a for loop to display the future ages.

**> Solution**
```
age = int(input('How old are you? '))
print()
print(f'You are {age} years old.')

for future in range(10, 50, 10):
    print(f'In {future} years, you will be {age + future} years old.')
```
