9\. Don't let the math scare you. This is a logic and syntax problem, not a math problem.

Write a function that computes and returns the factorial of a number by using a for or while loop. The factorial of a positive integer n, signified by n!, is defined as the product of all integers between 1 and n, inclusive:

n!	Expansion	Result
1!	1	1
2!	1 * 2	2
3!	1 * 2 * 3	6
4!	1 * 2 * 3 * 4	24
5!	1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5	120
You may assume that the argument is always a positive integer.

```
print(factorial(1))   # 1
print(factorial(2))   # 2
print(factorial(3))   # 6
print(factorial(4))   # 24
print(factorial(5))   # 120
print(factorial(6))   # 720
print(factorial(7))   # 5040
print(factorial(8))   # 40320
print(factorial(25))  # 15511210043330985984000000
```

**> Solution**
```
# using a while loop
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    while n > 0:
        result *= n
        n -= 1

    return result

# using a for loop
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for number in range(n, 0, -1): # range(1, n + 1) works as well
        result *= number

    return result

# using recursion
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else
        return n * factorial(n - 1)
```
