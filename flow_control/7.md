7\. Write a function that takes a single integer argument and prints a message that describes whether:

- the value is between 0 and 50 (inclusive)
- the value is between 51 and 100 (inclusive)
- the value is greater than 100
- the value is less than 0
```
number_range(0)     # 0 is between 0 and 50
number_range(25)    # 25 is between 0 and 50
number_range(50)    # 50 is between 0 and 50
number_range(75)    # 75 is between 51 and 100
number_range(100)   # 100 is between 51 and 100
number_range(101)   # 101 is greater than 100
number_range(-1)    # -1 is less than 0
```
**> Solution**
```
def number_range(num):
    if number < 0:
        print(f'{number} is less than 0')
    elif number <= 50:
        print(f'{number} is between 0 and 50')
    elif number <= 100:
        print(f'{number} is between 50 and 100')
    else:
        print(f'{number} is greater than 100')
```
