3\. Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 2 ways that lists and tuples are similar.

**> Solution**\
Lists and tuples are both collections, specifically sequences. As sequences, both are iterable, can be indexed, and have a length. Both are heterogenous, and can contain any object as elements. However, lists are mutable and tuples are immutable. That means you can use indexing to edit an element in a list, but you can only access elements in a tuple. List literals use [] and tuple literals use ().
