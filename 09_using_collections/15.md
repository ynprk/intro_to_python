15\. Without running the following code, what values will be printed by line 10?
```
pets = {
    'Cat':  'Meow',
    'Dog':  'Bark',
    'Bird': 'Tweet',
}

keys = pets.keys()
del pets['Dog']
pets['Snake'] = 'Sssss'
print(keys)
```

**> Solution**
```
dict_keys(['Cat', 'Bird', 'Snake'])
```
Since dict.keys() returns a dictionary view object, any changes you make to the dictionary after you call the dict.keys() method will be reflected immediately in the view obect.
