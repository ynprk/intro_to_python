12\. Write some code that determines and prints whether the number 3 appears inside each of these lists:
```
numbers1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
numbers2 = []
numbers3 = [2, 4, 6, 8]
numbers4 = ['1', '3', '5']
numbers5 = ['1', 3.0, '5']
```
You should print True or False depending on each result.

**> Solution**
```
print(3 in numbers1) # True
print(3 in numbers2) # False
print(3 in numbers3) # False
print(3 in numbers4) # False (3 != '3')
print(3 in numbers5) # True (3 == 3.0)
```
