2\. Classify the following potential **function** names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

| **Name**          |
| ----------------- |
| `index`           |
| `CatName`         |
| `lazy_dog`        |
| `quick_Fox`       |
| `1stCharacter`    |
| `operand2`        |
| `BIG_NUMBER`      |
| `π`               |

**> Solution**\
Function names in Python follow the same convention as variable names, so the answer to this question is the same as the answer to the previous question.

| **Name**          | **Status**         |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | 
| `index`           | idiomatic          |
| `CatName`         | non-idiomatic      |
| `lazy_dog`        | idiomatic          |
| `quick_Fox`       | non-idiomatic      |
| `1stCharacter`    | illegal            |
| `operand2`        | idiomatic          | 
| `BIG_NUMBER`      | non-idiomatic      |
| `π`               | non-idiomatic      |

Non-idiomatic:\
CatName: uses PascalCase, which is used for class names. cat_name would be idiomatic.\
quick_Fox: capitalizes the letter after the underscore. quick_fox would be idiomatic.\
BIG_NUMBER: uses SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE, which is used for constants. big_number would be idiomatic.\
π: contains a non-ASCII character. pi would be idiomatic.

Illegal:\
1stCharacter: starts with a number. first_character would be idiomatic.
