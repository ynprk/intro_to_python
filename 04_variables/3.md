3\. Classify the following potential **constant** names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.
| **Name**          |
| ----------------- |
| `index`           |
| `CatName`         |
| `snake_case`      |
| `LAZY_DOG3`       |
| `1ST`             |
| `operand2`        |
| `BIG_NUMBER`      |
| `Π`               |

**> Solution**
| **Name**          | **Status**         |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | 
| `index`           | non-idiomatic      |
| `CatName`         | non-idiomatic      |
| `snake_case`      | non-idiomatic      |
| `LAZY_DOG3`       | idiomatic          |
| `1ST`             | illegal            |
| `operand2`        | non-idiomatic      | 
| `BIG_NUMBER`      | idiomatic          |
| `Π`               | non-idiomatic      |

Non-idiomatic:\
index, snake_case, and operand2 use snake_case. CatName uses PascalCase. We should use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants. INDEX, SNAKE_CASE, OPERAND2, and CAT_NAME would be idiomatic (though maybe not SNAKE_CASE, that's just confusing). Π contains a non-ASCII character. PRODUCT would be idiomatic.

Illegal:\
1ST: identifiers cannot start with a number. FIRST would be idiomatic.
