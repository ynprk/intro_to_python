1. Create a directory named `my_folder` and navigate to that directory. Create two files named `one.py` and `two.py` in `my_folder`. Add the following Python code to `one.py`:

```
print('This is file one')
```
Write a similar program in `two.py` that prints `This is file two`.

When finished, run both programs with the `python` command.

**> Solution**
```
$ mkdir my_folder
$ cd my_folder
$ touch one.py
$ touch two.py
$ echo "print('This is file one')" > one.py
$ echo "print('This is file one')" > one.py

$ python one.py
This is file one

$ python two.py
This is file two
```
