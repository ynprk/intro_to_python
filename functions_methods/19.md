19\. The following function returns a list of the remainders of dividing the numbers in numbers by 5:
```
def remainders_5(numbers):
    return [number % 5 for number in numbers]
```
Use this function to determine which of the following lists do not contain any numbers that are divisible by 5:
```
numbers_1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
numbers_2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]
numbers_3 = [0, 5, 10]
numbers_4 = []
```
Note: when working with integers, a value of 0 is "falsy"; all other integers are "truthy".

**> Solution**\
all(remainders_5(list)) returns true if at all elements in remainders_5(list) are truthy. If list contains an element that is divisible by 5, its remainder will be 0, which is falsy. Thus, all(remainders_5(list)) is True iff list only contains numbers that are not divisible by 5.
```
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_1))) # False
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_2))) # True
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_3))) # False
print(all(remainders_5(numbers_4))) # True
```
