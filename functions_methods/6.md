6\. What does the following code print?
```
def scream(words):
    words = words + '!!!!'
    return
    print(words)

scream('Yipeee')
```

**> Solution**\
This function doesn't output anything. The print statement is after the return statement, which terminates the function. In order to print, the print statement has to be placed before the return statement.
