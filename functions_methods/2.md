2\. Take a look at this code snippet:
```
foo = 'bar'

def set_foo():
    foo = 'qux'

set_foo()
print(foo)
```
What does this program print? Why?

**> Solution**\
It prints `bar`. The assignment on line 4 created a new variable that is local to the function. The local `foo` variable on line 4 shadows the global `foo` variable on line 1, so line 4 doesn't change the value of `foo` from line 1.
