1\. What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?
```
def set_foo():
    foo = 'bar'

set_foo()
print(foo)
```

**> Solution**\
We get an error `NameError: name 'foo' is not defined`. Because the variable foo is defined inside a function, its scope is limited to inside that function.
