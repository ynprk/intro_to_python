8\. Explain why the code below prints different values on lines 3 and 4.
```
text = "It's probably pining for the fjords!"

print(text[21:35].rfind('f'))     # 8
print(text.rfind('f', 21, 35))    # 29
```

**> Solution**\
Both methods are finding the same character.\
However, when you splice the text first, you get the index of the character in the substring `text[21:35]`.\ Whereas when the splice is passed in as arguments to `rfind`, you get the index of the character in the entire string.
