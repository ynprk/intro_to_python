4\. This is a 3-part question. Consider the following dictionary:
```
pets = {
    'Cat':  'Meow',
    'Dog':  'Bark',
    'Bird': 'Tweet',
}
```
Part 1: Write some code to print Bark by accessing the element associated with the key Dog.
Part 2: Write some code to print None when you try to print the value associated with the non-existent key, Lizard.
Part 3: Write some code to print <silence> when you try to print the value associated with the non-existent key, Lizard.

**> Solution**
```
print(pets['Dog']) # Part 1
print(pets.get('Lizard')) # Part 2, pets['Lizard'] would yield an error
print(pets.get('Lizard', '<silence>')) # Part 3
```
dict.get method returns the value associated with a given key if the key exists.\ 
Otherwise, it returns None (or the specificed value).
