5\. Which of the following values can't be used as a key in a dict object, and why?
```
'cat'
(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2)
['a', 'b']
{'a': 1, 'b': 2}
range(5)
{1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
3
0.0
frozenset({1, 4, 9, 16, 25})
```

**> Solution**
```
'cat' # Yes
(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2) # Yes
['a', 'b'] # No
{'a': 1, 'b': 2} # No
range(5) # Yes
{1, 4, 9, 16, 25} # No
3 # Yes
0.0 # Yes
frozenset({1, 4, 9, 16, 25}) # Yes
```
The values that cannot be used as a key are a list, a dict, and a set.\ 
Since all three types are mutable, they can't be used as dict keys, which need to be hashable.\ All remaining items are immutable built-in objects; they are acceptable dict keys.
