```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
another_list = list(my_list)
```
Given the above code, answer the following questions and explain your answers:

Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal?\
Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object?\
Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal?\
Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object?\
Don't write any code for this exercise.

**> Solution**\
Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list equal? Yes\
Are the lists assigned to my_list and another_list the same object? No\
Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list equal? Yes\
Are the nested lists at index 3 of my_list and another_list the same object? Yes\
The list constructor creates a shallow copy of the object. This means the nested list ([4, 5, 6]) will be the same object, but the outer lists (my_list and another_list) will be different objects.
