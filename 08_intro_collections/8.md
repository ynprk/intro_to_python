8\. How would you print all the numbers in the following range?
```
range(3, 17, 4)
```

**> Solution**
```
print(list(range(3, 17, 4)))
print(tuple(range(3, 17, 4)))
```
If we call print on range(3, 17, 4) without using list or tuple, it will print range(3, 17, 4) because ranges are lazy sequences -- they don't create any element values if the program doesn't need them.
