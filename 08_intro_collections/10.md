10\. Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.
```
names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)
```
**> Solution**\
No. Sets are unordered collections, so we don't know what order the elements will be in.
