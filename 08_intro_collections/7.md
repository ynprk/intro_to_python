7\. Without running the following code, identify the numbers that are included in each of the following ranges:
```
range(7)
range(1, 6)
range(3, 15, 4)
range(3, 8, -1)
range(8, 3, -1)
```
**> Solution**
```
range(7) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
range(1, 6) # 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
range(3, 15, 4) # 3, 7, 11
range(3, 8, -1) # empty range
range(8, 3, -1) # 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
```
