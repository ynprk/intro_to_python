2\. Can you write some code to change the value 'bye' in the following tuple to 'goodbye'?
```
stuff = ('hello', 'world', 'bye', 'now')
```
Note: this problem is a bit tricky.

**> Solution**\
I cannot directly change the value 'bye' because tuples are immutable. However, I can create another tuple with the value 'goodbye' instead.
```
stuff = list(stuff)
list[2] = 'goodbye'
stuff = tuple(stuff)
```
