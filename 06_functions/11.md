11\. Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?
```
def foo(first, second=3, third=2):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)

foo(42)
```

**> Solution**
```
42 
3
2
```
Since we passed in one argument, the default values for the second and third parameters are used.
