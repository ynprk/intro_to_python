13\. Without running the following code, what do you think it will do?
```
def foo(first, second=3, third):
    print(first)
    print(second)
    print(third)

foo(42)
```

**> Solution**\
The code will raise a SyntaxError as the function is not defined properly. Since the second parameter has a default value, all subsequent parameters need to have a default value as well.
