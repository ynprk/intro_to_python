18\. The following function returns a list of the remainders of dividing the numbers in numbers by 3:
```
def remainders_3(numbers):
    return [number % 3 for number in numbers]
```
Use this function to determine which of the following lists contains at least one number that is not evenly divisible by 3 (that is, the remainder is not 0):
```
numbers_1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers_2 = [1, 2, 4, 5]
numbers_3 = [0, 3, 6]
numbers_4 = []
```
Note: when working with integers, a value of 0 is "falsy"; all other integers are "truthy".

**> Solution**\
any(remainders_3(list)) returns True if at least one element in remainders_3(list) is truthy. If an element in list is not divisible by 3, its remainder will be 1 or 2, which is truthy since all non-zero integers are truthy. That is, a list contains at least one number that is not evenly divisible by 3 if any(remainders_3(list)) returns True.

```
print(any(remainders_3(numbers_1))) # True
print(any(remainders_3(numbers_2))) # True
print(any(remainders_3(numbers_3))) # False
print(any(remainders_3(numbers_4))) # False
```
